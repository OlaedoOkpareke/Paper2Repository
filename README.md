# Paper2Repository

This repository can be found at https://github.com/OlaedoOkpareke/Paper2Repository.

First run the rscript file, this creates the datasets.  Then run the bib file for references and citations, then run the rmd file.

The repository is organised as follows:

1. The Outputs folder: 

The .bib file contains the citations for the raw data, packages and literature used in the report.

The rmd file contains the analysis report on US Birth rates from 2000 to 2020, as well as the code used to create the report. This code was mainly used to create tables and graphs.

The pdf file contains the same analysis report but in pdf form, and without the code.

2. The Inputs folder:

The dta files are the files downloaded from the original paper's data package. 
The csv files contains the convertes csv datasets used in the report. 

3. The Scripts folder:

The r script contains code for downloading the data and converting them to csv form.

4. Main Code repository with data and paper folder:

This contains the reproduction package. The r script file within this package contains the code to load in the data, as well as the code to replicate the three graphs. 

Note: The original data folder was too large to be loaded into R studio properly, so for this analysis the relevant files were uploaded individually.
